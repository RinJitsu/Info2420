<h2>INFO 2450 - Project 1: Web Site Critique</h2>

<h3>Trader Joe's - <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">http://www.traderjoes.com/</a></h3>

<p><strong>First Impression:</strong> My first impression of the page is it is bright, colorful, and inviting. The main page immediately shows promotions and popular products, and that makes the site feel friendly.</p>

<p><strong>Flow of Information:</strong> The site has a top navigation bar for categories such as "Products," "Recipes," and "Find a Store". Images accompanied by text below the navigation are organized and systemized into sections which made it easy to explore.</p>

<p><strong>Site Structure:</strong> Organization seems accurate. Everything seems to be grouped together logically. It's pretty easy and clear to find where to go and not get lost in the section.</p>

<p><strong>Graphics/Layout/Multimedia:</strong> The graphics are vibrant and fun and contribute to the site without being excessive. Product images at least give the user a general idea of current offerings.</p>

<p><strong>Load Time:</strong> The homepage loaded in a couple of seconds. Load time was reasonable and did not interrupt browsing.</p>

<p><strong>Text Readability:</strong> Text is readable overall and has good contrast. Background color is calm and doesn't detract from text and reading.</p>

<p><strong>Navigation:</strong> The top navigation bar and use of dropdown menus allow for straight forward movement through the site area. Navigation is well executed.</p>

<p><strong>Color Scheme/Look and Feel:</strong> The site has one color scheme overall with bright reds, greens, and whites that are consistent with Trader Joe's branding.</p>

<p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The site responds well should the window be smaller. On mobile devices, the site collapses to a hamburger menu while still maintaining usability.</p>

<p><strong>Unique or Well-Done Features:</strong> The site features unique product spotlights and easy access to recipe area. The graphics aligned with Trader Joe's brand and fun, interactive playful graphics allow for an awesome experience!</p>
